# Infinity RPG (Unofficial FoundryVTT System)

This is a personal adaptation of the *Star Trek Adventures* FoundryVTT system originally created by [mkscho63](https://github.com/mkscho63/sta). That system was shared under an open license and much of this work directly builds upon their foundation, including layout, structure, and mechanics. I am deeply grateful for their work and generosity in making it public and modifiable.

## Purpose

This project aims to rework that system for use with *Infinity: The Roleplaying Game*, published by Modiphius. Both games are built on the 2d20 system, which makes much of the architecture transferable, but adjustments are being made to reflect Infinity's unique mechanics, themes, and setting.

My goals for this project are small in scale. I am building this primarily for personal use, to facilitate games among friends. It is not intended as an official product, nor am I aiming for widespread distribution or polish. However, in the spirit of open collaboration and shared creativity, I am happy to make this work public.

## License

This project is released under an open license. You are welcome to:
- Use it in your own games
- Modify it
- Distribute your own versions or forks
- Incorporate it into your own projects

No attribution is required, though credit is always appreciated. There are no restrictions on use, provided it is not misrepresented as an official Modiphius or Infinity product.

## Status

This is a work in progress. Many elements from the original Star Trek Adventures system remain and will be gradually replaced or removed. Contributions, feedback, or issue reports are welcome, but please note that development may be sporadic.
